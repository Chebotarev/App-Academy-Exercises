  The topics of the day at App Academy were blocks and recursion. It was by far
  the most difficult subject matter so far. My partner and I got thorough the
  exercises on blocks almost in the first hour, and spent the rest of the day on
  recursion. We monkey-patched the Array class with methods that emulated
  <b>each, map, select</b> and <b>inject</b> with blocks.

  Recursion was a difficult topic, and each exercise required a lot of planning
  beforehand. The concept is to break down a problem into smaller, yet similar,
  parts until the parts are trivial to solve. In the simple case of a factorial,
  every factorial <code>n!<code> can be rewritten as <code>n * (n-1)!</code>.
  Therefore we can write a method:
</p>

<code>
  def factorial(n)
    return 1 if n == 0
    n * factorial(n-1)
  end
</code>

<p>
  The key is that the method <b>factorial</b> calls itself and only returns in
  the trivial case that <b>0! = 1</b>. Each recursive call to factorial gets
  closer to the "base case", using <a href="#">induction</a> to solve the
  problem.

<h3>Useful Tips</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Recursion can be difficult to visualize, be sure to draw a branching
  diagram for complex problems</li>
  <li>You can call <b>object.class.new</b> to instatiate an empty instance of
  the object, as long as it doesn't override <b>new</b> with factory methods!</li>
</ul>
