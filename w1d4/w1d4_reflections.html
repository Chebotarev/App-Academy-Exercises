  The topics of the day at App Academy were blocks and recursion. It was by far
  the most difficult subject matter so far. My partner and I got thorough the
  exercises on blocks almost in the first hour, and spent the rest of the day on
  recursion. We monkey-patched the Array class with methods that emulated
  <b>each, map, select</b> and <b>inject</b> with blocks.

  Recursion was a difficult topic, and each exercise required a lot of planning
  beforehand. The concept is to break down a problem into smaller yet similar
  parts until the parts are trivial to solve. In the simple case of a factorial,
  every factorial <code>n!<code> can be rewritten as <code>n * (n-1)!</code>.
  Therefore we can write a method:
