  We had our first assessment today! It covered a variety of topics including
  recursion, blocks and various array methods. I felt it was a fair test and in
  the end I got all the specs to pass. Afterwards we had a lecture on JSON and
  YAML serialization given by Andrew.

<h3>Useful Tips</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Use <strong>to_json / to_yaml</strong> and <strong>JSON::parse(some_json)
  / YAML::load(some_yaml)</strong>to convert Ruby objects into the respective
  formats <em>(Note: Unlike YAML, JSON does not natively support converting
    custom classes, although it is possible to overwrite the to_json method)</em></li>
    <li></li>
</ul>
