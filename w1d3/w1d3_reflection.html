  There were only two projects for the day: MasterMind and Hangman. The previous
  two days at App Academy were focused on writing many small methods that
  exemplified a few concepts in Ruby each. The games we had to implement today
  were longer and required use to synthesize many different concepts together.
  Instead of having a single method <em>(and a few helper methods)</em>, my
  partner and I ended up having longer classes with interacting methods. We
  focused on keeping our code clean and readable by breaking up long
  methods. Part of our assignments last night was to listen to a great talk
  by Ben Orenstein called <a href="#">Refactoring from Good to Great</a>, which
  I enjoyed a great deal.
