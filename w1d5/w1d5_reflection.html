  It was another tough but enlightening day at App Academy. We finished off the first week with a lecture on basic data structures given by Ryan Glassett. He gave an overview of linked lists, stacks and queues, as well as the methods the Ruby <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/Array.html" target="_blank">Array class</a> has to replicate each structure. We looked at trees and how to implement <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search" target="_blank">breadth first search</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search" target="_blank">depth first search</a>.

  There were three major projects today:
<ul>
	<li><strong>PolyTreeNode</strong> - A class simulating a tree that can have many children</li>
	<li><strong>Knight's Travail</strong> - Finding the shortest path a knight can take from one position on a chess board to another utilizing the PolyTreeNode class</li>
	<li><strong>TicTacToe Artificial Intelligence</strong> - An AI for the Tic Tac Toe game we implemented earlier in the week that is unbeatable <em>(assuming you don't cheat)</em></li>
</ul>

The hardest of these problems was the Tic Tac Toe AI. It works by traversing a tree representing all possible states of the board and only choosing moves that will lead to a winning state <em>(or at the very least not a losing state)</em>

    <li>Don't mess with the AI, it's in charge now</li>
