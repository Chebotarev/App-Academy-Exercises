The day started off with our first technical lecture which was given by CJ.
Instead of a traditional lecture format, he started with a messy implementation
of the Towers of Hanoi problem we solved yesterday and refactored it with us.
There were so many questions that we ended up talking about some of the intricacies
of Ruby itself, including the Kernel module that has a global scope in all
Ruby programs. In the context of the Towers of Hanoi problem, we learned about
keeping our methods short <em>(always less than 10 lines)</em> and using
descriptive variable names <em>(even if they have to be longer)</em>. This will
keep the code readable and limit the need for long-winded comments.
