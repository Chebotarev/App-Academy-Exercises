  Today was all about Chess! David gave a lecture that focused on strategies for
  completing the project. This included tips on duplicating the board and all of
  its pieces <em>(without leaving references to the original pieces)</em> as well
  as checking if players were in check or checkmate.

  My partner and I got all the major features working, and even implemented a
  simple AI <em>(that does random moves but gives priority to taking pieces)</em>.
  Our Game class is generalized enough that it is possible to pass it any
  combination of two player classes, so by the end of the day we had two AIs
  playing each other. This turned out to be an intersting debugging tool, since
  they could perform a lot of unusual moves very quickly. As a result, we
  discovered a bug that allowed our Pawns to jump from one end of the board to
  the other! We also updated the user interface and refactored a lot of the code
  base using the principles of <a href="#">DRY</a> and <a href="#">single responsibility</a>.
